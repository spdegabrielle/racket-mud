@title{Racket-MUD Server Administration}

This section will be developed later: once Racket-MUD is a proper Racket package, and can be interacted with via the 'raco' command.

For now, if you want to run the MUD engine, do what I do: open @tt{racket-mud/mud/main.rkt} in DrRacket and click @bold{Run}.

Other administrative tasks? You're on your own, for now.
