#+TITLE: qtMUD Project History & Roadmap
#+TODO: PLAN TEMPLATE DRAFT TEST RELEASE | RELEASED
#+TODO: TODO | DONE

* PLAN 0.1.0
** [0/3] Milestones
Here's some things that need to be possible for this version to be "complete".:

- [ ] The server can be started and shut down
- [ ] The server can read its configuration from environmental variables
- [ ] A client can connect via telnet and [0/2]:
  - [ ] register an account
  - [ ] log into their account and then [0/4]:
    - [ ] query information about an account
    - [ ] use the talker (in-game chat channels) [0/4]:
      - [ ] join a channel
      - [ ] leave a channel
      - [ ] send a message
      - [ ] receive a message
    - [ ] use a help command
    - [ ] send a message directly to another client

Since this is the very first version, this is a pretty general view of what might be a fairly complicated set of things.

And, there might be more that I add to this list later.
** [0/20] Step-by-step
*** TODO Ticking engine
I think the first thing I need to do is create a basic application in Racket. By application, I mean a thing that lets me do "racket qtmud.rkt" and it starts up a thing that stays running until I give it a =^C=.
*** TODO MUDSocket service
The second step is fleshing out a MUDSocket service: something that can start, run, tick, and shutdown, just like the engine. It doesn't have to do anything more for now.
*** TODO Engine runs MUDSocket service
Tie in starting, running, and stopping the MUDSocket service with the main engine.
*** TODO Engine reads environmental variables
Create some functions for reading relevant environmental variables.
*** TODO MUDSocket services read its host and port from environmental variables
*** TODO MUDSocket service binds to a port and release it on shutdown
*** TODO MUDSocket service accepts an incoming connection
Accept any incomign connection, send it some text, then drop it.
*** TODO Engine creates Things
*** TODO MUDSocket assigns new Thing to connection
*** TODO Engine accepts event registration & calling of subscribed events
*** TODO MUDSocket registers "send message to Thing" when new connection is accepted and given a Thing
*** TODO MUDSocket accepts lines from connections and registers send event to echo it
*** TODO Create basic parser
*** TODO MUDSocket assigns basic parser to new connections
*** TODO Create help command
*** TODO Create login parser
*** TODO MUDSocket assigns login parser to new connections
*** TODO Create finger command
*** TODO Create talker command
*** TODO Create tell command
** Implementation
This section is organized in mirror of the package's file structure, and will contain the templates for the functions to implement the above.

I'm brand-new to Racket, so this might change a lot. Iunno.
